Welcome to the first lecture of the reinforcement learning course. In this session, we'll explore foundational concepts crucial for understanding future topics, using intuitive examples and formal definitions within the Markov Decision Processes framework.

## Introduction to Grid-World

### What is a Grid-World?

- **Grid-World**: A grid where a robot navigates to reach target areas.
  - **Accessible Cells**: Indicated by white.
  - **Forbidden Cells**: Indicated by yellow, which the robot should avoid.
  - **Boundaries**: The robot cannot move beyond the grid's edges.
  - **Movement**: The robot moves left, right, up, and down.

**Illustration Needed**: Consider adding an image of a grid-world with labeled cells.

### Task Objective

- **Goal**: Find an optimal path from the start to the target.
- **Challenges**: Avoid forbidden areas, unnecessary detours, and crossing boundaries.

## Key Concepts

### State

- **Definition**: Describes the agent's status in the environment.
- **Example**: In grid-world, a state refers to a location (e.g., s1, s2, s3).
- **State Space (S)**: The set of all possible states.

### Action

- **Definition**: Series of actions possible in each state.
- **Example**: Actions (a1-a5) include moving up, right, down, left, and staying still.
- **Action Space (A)**: The set of all possible actions, dependent on the state.

### State Transition

- **Definition**: Process of moving from one state to another by taking an action.
- **Example**: In state s1, action a2 (moving right) transitions to s2.
- **Deterministic vs. Stochastic**: State transitions can be certain or probabilistic.

**Note**: A table representing state transitions might be useful for deterministic cases.

### State Transition Probability

- **Introduction to Probability**: Used to describe transitions in uncertain scenarios.
- **Example**: Probability of moving from s1 to s2 by action a2 is 1 (deterministic) or 0.5 if stochastic.

### Policy

- **Definition**: Guides the agent on which actions to take in each state.
- **Representation**: Arrows for intuitive understanding, Ï€ for mathematical expression.
- **Deterministic vs. Stochastic**: Policies can be certain or probabilistic.

**Illustration Needed**: A diagram showing policy arrows for different states.

### Policy Execution

- **Implementation**: Use random sampling to decide actions based on probabilities.
- **Example**: If a policy has a 0.5 probability for actions a2 and a3, random sampling determines the action.
